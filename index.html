  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a dynamic professional with a passion for helping people make smart decisions—
    whether it's finding their dream home, planning unforgettable getaways, or
    streamlining operations for smoother systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    With over three years in real estate sales and a solid background in administration and client service,
    I thrive on building relationships, closing deals, and creating seamless experiences from the first hello
    to the final handshake. My love for travel planning is where my inner adventurer meets my logistical brain,
    bringing joy and order in perfect balance.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the role I cherish most? Mama. Motherhood has made me a better multitasker, deepened my empathy,
    and sharpened my people skills in ways no training ever could.
  </p>
  <p>
    This portfolio is a growing reflection of who I am—professionally and personally.
    Let’s connect and create something amazing!
